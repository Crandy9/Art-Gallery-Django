chmod og+X /home/lctec

-Then get into postgres cmd shell with default user 
(to quit enter \q):
sudo -u postgres psql

-Reset root password to create new user:
('root' is example, change to more complex password 
for production)
ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'root';

\q

-Now, to enter postgresql enter:
-connect to postgresql with superuser:
psql -U postgres -h localhost

verify that your django db was previously created in postgresql by 
entering 'psql -U postgres -h localhost' and then '\l'
