Create venv:
cd to location where venv is to be stored 
(Windows): "py -m venv project-name"
(linux): mkdir venv-name and then cd to venv-name


Activate venv:
(windows): project-name\Scripts\activate
(linux) while in venv dir: . bin/activate or source bin/activate
then cd back to project

to run django project
*MAKE SURE PSYCOPG2 and PILLOW ARE INSTALLED*:
(windows): python manage.py runserver
(linux): python3 manage.py runserver

Deactivate venv:
deactivate

In VS code, change python interpreter to venv path interpreter located
at: 
(windows): venv-name\Scripts\
(linux): use venv dir and it should be located at /bin/python3.10

In VS Code terminal (cmd), create new app (separations of concerns):
while in venv:
python manage.py startapp appname

When creating new apps, remember to copy/pase ursl.py from another app into new app (doesn't come automatically with startapp cmd)
And then map the urls from your newly created app to the main project's ursls.py
