Postgres: on Ubuntu, check if postgresql is installed with this command: which psql (should be in /usr/bin/psql)
Superuser: postgres
Password: 1234
Port where server will listen on: 5432
master password for pgAdmin: 1234

Creating/connecting/migrating data to postgresql db:

-after database is created (in pgadmin just right click "add new db") in adminpg and models are setup in models.py:
migrate models to postgresql and create the tables in cmd:

-Before migration, make sure that the models.py is available in the installed apps
- go to project settings.py and add the application name to INSTALLED_APPS dictionary
Create migation file under migrations dir in app:
python manage.py makemigrations

-To verify it worked, there should be a new file under the migrations dir that looks something like
"0001_initial.py"

- to actually perform migration to adminpg db:
python manage.py migrate

- table should be created in adminpg

- to update db when models changed, do a re-migration:
python manage.py makemigrations

-if updating an integer field, follow prompt to add default value in cmd

-migrate
python manage.py migrate
- each re-migration creates a new migration file under migrations dir

-to create superuser for /admin page (MUST HAVE ABOVE DB STEPS COMPLETED BEFORE CREATING ADMIN SUPERUSER)
 enter: python manage.py createsuperuser
 enter details, then you can login into admin page 
 username: lctec
 email address: lctechnology@protonmail.com
 password: 1234 (will not show on cmd, bypass security concerns if desired by entering y)
 - superuser will be created as an auth_user in pgadmin
 - changes made in the admin page are automatically reflected in pgadmin tables
